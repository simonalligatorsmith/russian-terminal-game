Terminal game that helps you learn spelling of words
DONE - MVP (minimum viable product)
    10 words. Output one to screen, makes you type it out and enter it. Takes away 2 letters each time until word is blank and you type from memory. Then congratulate and move on to next word
    
    
Next:
    store learned/practiced words in another file (database one day) along with date of practice
        review learned words periodically
        
    get big wordlist from frequency list
